# Sales-Funnel-Conversion-Optimization
With SQL queries I will analyze event flow to gain insights into the potential buyersâ€™ behavior. A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.  The goal of this project is to optimize the sales funnel of an e-commerce website.
