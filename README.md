# Sales-Funnel-Conversion-Optimization
With SQL queries I will analyze event flow to gain insights into the potential buyers’ behavior. A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.  The goal of this project is to optimize the sales funnel of an e-commerce website.

#Forecasting Ice Cream Revenue
 This project finds the relationship between the independent variable (outside air temperatures) and its effect on the dependent variable (daily revenue). The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the daily revenue ($) depending on the temperature (Celsius) outside.

#Data cleaning and importing Python Libraries
The initial data received in a CSV file  included the columns "Temperature" in Celsius and "Revenue". I wanted to converted temperature from metric to imperial units. So I created a Fahrenheit row in Excel (pictured below). Saved that file and proceeded to my Jupyter Notebook to being the process of analyzing the data with Python.

Next, I imported all Python libraries necessary to analysis the data.
